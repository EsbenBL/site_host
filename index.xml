      <description>We plot a bipartite scientist-topic network with edge weights based on the XX probabilities from the hSBM model. The nodes and edges are colored based on their scientific discipline.
Alright, so.. it&amp;rsquo;s a hairball. To have a better shot at observing some kind of structure, we remove edges with weights below the 75%-quartile. Here we go;
That&amp;rsquo;s better, Ganon!</description>

      <title>Creating a New Theme</title>

      <description>Introduction#This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Community Detection#We have used Louvain Partition to make communities. In the plot below, we have plotted the community size for each of the 22 detected communities. Note that this is based on the GCC;
Community Size#As expected from the initial examination of the plotted network, most of the nodes are partitioned onto 5-8 very large communities, followed by a series of remarkably smaller communities. The plot below shows the distribution of community size, where each community is named after the 3 most connected nodes in the given community.</description>

      <description>Data#Here we have the datasets which we have used for the project.
The Wikipedia Lists#Here we link to the five social science lists, which our project is build upon.
  Sociologists
  Psychologists
  Political Scientists
  Economists
  Anthropologists

      <description>Degree Distribution#We present the degree distribution of the network.
Here is the in-degree distribution:
And here is the out-degree distribution:
How about that, Ganon?</description>

      <description>Louvain Modularity#The Louvain algorithm partitions the network by finding the partition that optimizes modularity, defined as (Barab√°si eq. 9.12): \(M = \sum_{c=1}^{n_c}\left[\frac{L_c}{L}-\left(\frac{k_c}{2L}\right)^2\right]\), where \(n_c\)is the number of communities/partitions, \(L\)is the total number of links in the network, \(L_c\)is the total number of links within community \(C_c\), and \(k_c\)is the total degree of the nodes in this community (including links to nodes outside community \(C_c\)).</description>

Here is the 50 highest in-degree nodes:

      <description>Proprocessing the data#To construct this &amp;ldquo;community&amp;rdquo; of social scientists, we found inspiration by examining the Faculty of Social Science at Copenhagen University. The Social Science faculty have five overall departments: Sociology, Psychology, Economy, Anthropology, and Political Science. For each of these five categories we have a list of scientists on wikipedia. We used these five lists of scientists to find and all the scientists in our final dataset.</description>

      <description>TF and TF-IDF#According to Wiki, there is a variaty of ways to calculate TF-IDF. We calculate TF-IDF in what appears to be the most conventional way, where the raw count, \( f_{t,d}\), of term \(t\)in document \( d\)is standardized/adjusted by the document length, \( \sum_{t&amp;#39;\in{d}}f_{t&amp;#39;,d}\), e.i. adjusted by the raw count of all the terms, \( t&amp;#39;\), in \(d\).</description>
