      <description>Topics within Disciplines#Below, we have plotted the distribution of the 21 topics within each of the scientific fields.
From the bar plots above, we infer that the contributions from each discipline vary dependent of the specific topic. Some topics have scientists from just one discipline as main contributors. This is especially true for the topics with titles we have named a specific discipline; Sociology, Anthropology, Economics, and Psychology.</description>

      <description>Topics within Communities#Below, we have plot the distribution of the 21 topics within each of the identified communities.
In our examination of the plots above, we mainly consider the largest communities, that we have previously described at the start of the analysis. The x-axis in the plots is sorted such that the largest communities are on the left. From the plots, we infer that the second largest community of Marx-Freud-Weber is the main contributor to the topic Philosophy.</description>
