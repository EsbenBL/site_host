      <description>Degree Distribution#We present the degree distribution of the network.
Here is the in-degree distribution:
And here is the out-degree distribution:
Both the in- and out-degree distribution appear to be powerlaw distributed, meaning that the growth of the network is linearly biased by the degree distributions of the pre-existing nodes in the network. This is indicated by the presence of few very high degree nodes, while most of the nodes have a much smaller degree in comparison.</description>

      <description>Most Connected Nodes#Below we plot the most connected nodes, both with regard to in- and out-degree:
Highest In-degree Nodes#Here is the 50 highest in-degree nodes:
Looking at the most connected nodes with regard to in-degree, we see many of the &amp;ldquo;founding fathers&amp;rdquo; of the social science disciplines. The most connected node is Karl Marx, the developer of the highly influential mode of state governance, &amp;ldquo;Communism&amp;rdquo;, and a central figure in both sociology and economy.</description>
