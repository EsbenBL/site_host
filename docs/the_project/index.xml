      <description>Proprocessing the data#To construct this &amp;ldquo;community&amp;rdquo; of social scientists, we found inspiration by examining the Faculty of Social Science at Copenhagen University. The Social Science faculty have five overall departments: Sociology, Psychology, Economy, Anthropology, and Political Science. For each of these five categories we have a list of scientists on wikipedia. We used these five lists of scientists to find and all the scientists in our final dataset.</description>
